# rails-i18n-helper

This is just a tiny function that helps grab the I18n key from a rails
yaml file for use elsewhere in the app.

to use it, run 

    :CopyI18nKey

This will put the Rails I18n key on the `"` register

# installation

I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) these days, so 

    Plug 'statbit/rails-i18n-helper' 

should to do the trick.
